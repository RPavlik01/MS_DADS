Statistical Data Mining focuses on concepts in data preparation and supervised and unsupervised machine learning
techniques. The course helps students gain basic knowledge in statistics, data preparation, regression, and dimensional
reduction. Learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth
relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course also explains when,
how, and why to use unsupervised models to best meet organizational needs. The following course is prerequisite: Data
Preparation and Exploration.

This course covers the following competencies:

● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.

● The learner performs linear and logistic regressions to make recommendations based on the results.

● The learner performs principal component analysis to make recommendations based on the results.
