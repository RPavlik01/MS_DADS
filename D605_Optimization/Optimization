Optimization is a large class of business problems requiring the iterative algorithmic maximization or minimization or one or
more variables. Students in this course will select and use a variety of optimization approaches to address various business
needs. The course covers classes of optimization problems at a foundational level (continuous/discrete, linear/nonlinear,
and bounded/unbounded) and the solving of linear optimization problems in both Python and R through the use of gradient
and non-gradient-based algorithms. Analytics Programming is a prerequisite.

This course covers the following competencies:

● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.

● The learner analyzes a business case to recommend a particular optimization approach.

● The learner identifies the objective function and constraints for an optimization problem.

● The learner solves an optimization problem programmatically.
