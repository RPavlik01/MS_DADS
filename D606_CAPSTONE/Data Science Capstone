The Data Science Capstone integrates the learning in the MSDA core and the three courses within the specialization. The
student evaluates various needs and opportunities in an organization or marketplace; identifies the business requirements;
translates the business requirements into technical requirements; and creates a comprehensive project plan to solve the
problem in a way that satisfies the customer or business needs. Projects within this specialization include the design and
