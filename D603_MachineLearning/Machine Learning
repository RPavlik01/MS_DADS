Machine Learning is the broad discipline of developing algorithms and statistical models to predict, classify, or cluster data
and that iteratively improve over time. Machine Learning focuses on building, training, running, and testing supervised and
unsupervised models and quantifying the accuracy and precision of those models to determine which may best be used in a
particular business situation. Supervised methods covered include k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees,
and support vector machines. Unsupervised models covered include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and tdistributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Ensemble methods are also presented. Prerequisites are Analytics
Programming and Statistical Data Mining.

This course covers the following competencies:

● Begin your course by discussing your course planning tool report with your instructor and creating your personalized
course plan together.

● The learner recommends a supervised machine learning model based on a comparison of model performance given a
business problem.

● The learner recommends an unsupervised machine learning model based on a comparison of model performance
given a business problem.

● The learner applies time series models in generating forecasts.
