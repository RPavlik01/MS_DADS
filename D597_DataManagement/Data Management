Data Management builds proficiency in using both relational and non-relational databases. Topics include selection of a data
storage architecture, data types, data structures, normalization and denormalization, and querying databases. Structured
Query Language (SQL) topics including Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) are
covered, including joins, aggregations, and transactions. Non-relational approaches to organizing and querying data are
contrasted with relational approaches to build competency in adapting data storage architectures to business needs.
